# What I learnt
I learned about Nuxt, a framework built on top of Vue. I expanded my knowledge
in Vue's ecosystem by building an e-commerce shop project. I learned about pages,
layouts, reusable components, route parameters, servers, apis and more. It was
an awesome tutorial brought by TheNetNinja and now I'm excited to build some
solo projects with Vue / Nuxt.
